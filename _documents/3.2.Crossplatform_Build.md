I know how to make executable on windows os using inno setup. Give detailed guide how to make my application installable on all versions and arch of macos and linux distro, only for RHEL, ubuntu, debian based distros as of now. Give detailed guide. Also I want to publish my app as a stand alone installer which can be downloaded from my site and also on app store. Same for linux installer, user can download from my site or from their distro repo. Give hands on step by step newbie friendly in depth detailed guide how to do so

Making your PyQt6 application installable on macOS and Linux, and distributing it through various channels like your website, app stores, and Linux repositories, is a multi-step process. Let's break it down for macOS and Linux separately:

### Distributing PyQt6 Applications on macOS:

**Step 1: Create a macOS Application Bundle**

1. You'll need a macOS system to build the application bundle. If you're not on macOS, you can use a virtual machine.

2. Organize your PyQt6 application into a macOS application bundle structure. Create the following structure:

   ```
   MyApp.app/
       Contents/
           MacOS/
               YourAppBinary
           Resources/
               your_icon.icns
   ```

3. Replace `MyApp` with your application name and `YourAppBinary` with the actual binary executable of your application. Place your app's icon file as `your_icon.icns` in the Resources folder.

**Step 2: Codesigning (For macOS App Store Distribution)**

1. To distribute your app on the App Store, you'll need to code sign your application using Apple's codesigning tools. Follow Apple's documentation for this step.

**Step 3: Creating an Installer (For Website Distribution)**

1. Create a macOS disk image (DMG) containing your `.app` bundle. You can use the `hdiutil` command-line tool or third-party tools like `create-dmg` for this purpose.

2. Create a download link for the DMG on your website.

**Step 4: Distribution through the App Store**

1. Prepare your app according to Apple's guidelines.

2. Create an Apple Developer account if you don't have one.

3. Submit your app for review through App Store Connect.

**Step 5: Distribution through Third-Party Stores**

1. You can also distribute your macOS app through third-party stores like Setapp.

2. Each third-party store will have its own submission process and requirements. Follow their guidelines.

### Distributing PyQt6 Applications on Linux:

**Step 1: Packaging for Linux**

1. Create packages for popular package managers like DEB (Debian, Ubuntu) and RPM (RHEL, Fedora). You can use tools like `dpkg` and `rpmbuild`.

2. Ensure that you include all necessary dependencies in your package.

**Step 2: Creating an Installer (For Website Distribution)**

1. For website distribution, create a downloadable package for both DEB and RPM.

2. Host these packages on your website and provide download links.

**Step 3: Distribution through Linux Repositories**

1. For distribution through official Linux repositories, you'll need to contact the maintainers of those repositories (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora) and follow their submission process.

2. They may have specific requirements for package contents, documentation, and licensing.

**Step 4: Self-Hosting Linux Packages**

1. If you want to distribute your Linux packages independently without relying on official repositories, you can host them on your website.

2. Users can download and install your packages manually.

Please note that the process of distributing software through official Linux repositories can be more complex due to their strict packaging guidelines and submission processes.

For macOS, you can distribute through the App Store, which has its own set of requirements and guidelines.

Ensure you comply with licensing, copyright, and any legal obligations when distributing your software.

Distributing software on multiple platforms requires thorough testing to ensure it works correctly on different systems.

Remember that this is a high-level overview, and each step may require more detailed work, especially for macOS and Linux packaging. Always refer to platform-specific documentation and guidelines for the most accurate information.
